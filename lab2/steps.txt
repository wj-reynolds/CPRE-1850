1) You have to make sure you a formatting using %d if you are going to provide it with an integer. It starts with %lf, which is for doubles.
2) On the second printf statement, you never provide it with a value to format the %d with, meaning it says 0.
3) You want to have a decimal result, but you use integer formatting with %d. You have to use float or double formatting with %f / %lf.

How I came up with formulas:
1) The circumference of a circle is 2 * PI * r; We can divide the circumference by 2PI to get the radius. The area of a circle is PI * r^2. We can use our newly found radius to calculate the area of the circle.
2) I looked up the conversion ratio between feet and meters on the PDF, and then divided the number of feet by that value.
3) I literally just followed the equation on the PDF. :)

Mismatch with arithmetic solution:
C) In letter C, we divide 12 by 5 using integers. This results in a truncation of the decimal place, resulting in a wrong answer. It should be 81.4
E) In letter E, we divide 22 by 3 using integers. This results in a truncation of the decimal place, resulting in a wrong answer. We truncate 7.33333 to 7, and then multiply by 3, resulting in 21 instead of 22.
F) In letter F, we have the same truncation problems. We divide 22 by (3 * 3) which is the same as 22 / 9. It should result in 2.44444 but instead is just 2, the wrong answer.
G) In letter G, we have the exact problem as F. Just because the variable is now a double instead of an integer doesn't mean we can divide unevenly using integer literals.
H) In letter H, we have the same problem as E. We cannot divide unevenly using integer literals. The proper value is 22, and we get 21.
J) In letter J, it's a similar problem to F. We do finally divide using doubles (hurray!), but then we store it in an integer (boo :( ). This results in a truncation down to 2.
